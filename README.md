# MERN healthapp project

Fullstack health application built with React, NodeJS, MongoDb and ChakraUI.

Purpose of the application
This application was built for a helaht care start up that offers an 8 week program for patients with back pain issues. The application can be used to connect patients with their health care providers and allow the patients to follow an 8 week excercise plan from home. There is also a possiblity to leave comments about the week (in a section that only the patient and their health care provider can see) so that the healht care provider can follow the patients progress. The application also has a profile section where stats around what excercises have been completed will be recorded. This section is currently under development and the profile data around completed excercises is currently populated with mock up data.
